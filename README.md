### Hi there,
List of programming languages I have experience with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* SQL
* C++ / C#

I like to do bots with python, for example I did Teamfight Tactics bot to start matches and leaving them in time (used pyautogui module), bot to sending email if item in shop is available (used selenium), and actually learning discord.py </br>
I made some games using html/css/js on browser like tic tac toe, or minesweeper </br>
C++ I used mainly for Arduino and C# for Unity. </br>

</br>
